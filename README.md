## What's all this?
It's the super-low-budget (aka "free") beginning of what I hope will be an interesting art experiment combining three things that are very interesting to me: Art, Evolution and Technology.  In order to spin this up, I need to gauge whether I can get some initial participation or it won't be very interesting at all, so let's start simple.   The general idea is to build a "forest of trees" of artistic interpretations and then create interesting ways to look at it and participate in its growth.  Still more generally:

* We are given a starting image and a timeframe/other limitations for growth
* During this timeframe one or more people submit interpretation/derivative works _based only on this image_ and they are submitted back as "branches".
* At any point, anyone may (following the same prescribed limitations of growth) submit interpretations of any branch.

Thus we wind up with (hopefully) interpretations of interpretations that become "trees".  

## Getting started
The best way to explain is probably to just start something, so here's [the first seedling](https://github.com/bkardell/spinnart/wiki/matahari) and it describes how to get started...
